Welcome to the Martian Roadtrip! 

This project details the preparations for a cross country roadtrip in an Electric Vehicle that will be run completely off-grid.  We will be carrying ALL the necessary food, water and power with us.

We will be working through all of the minutia of planning and engineering step-by-step.  We will break down and analyze everything from energy consumption to solar panel comparisons, deployment strategies,   supply selection, electronics design, and everything else required. 

And once we're ready for the trip, we will document the whole thing - including all the problems we encounter along the way.

Whether we succeed or fail, we will learn from the journey.

Join us!
