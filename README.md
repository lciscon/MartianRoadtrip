Welcome to the Martian Roadtrip project! 

This project details the preparations for a cross country roadtrip in an Electric Vehicle that is completely self-supporting.  We will be carrying all the necessary food, water and power with us.

We will be going through all of the minutia of planning and engineering for the project step-by-step.  We will break down and analyze everything from energy consumption, to solar panel comparisons, deployment strategies, choosing supplies, designing electronics, and everything else required. 

And once we're ready for the actual trip we will document our path - including all the problems we encounter along the way.

Whether we succeed or fail in the trip, we will learn from the journey.

Join us!
