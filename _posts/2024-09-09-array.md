So how big of a solar array do we need to produce 52kWh per day?  

Factors that affect power output include geographic location, physical size, power efficiency, and panel layout among other things.  Let's work through this step-by-step:

First we have to estimate how much energy we can collect from the sun each day.  This varies based upon the latitude and the time of the year.  There are several good software applications that will simulate this and give you precise data.  the one I used is called System Advisor Model (SAM) produced by Sandia National Labs.

Assuming we stay on roughly the 34th parallel (i.e. Dallas) and we travel in the fall or spring, we will get roughly 6 hours of peak sunlight a day.  Dividing 52K by 6 means we'll need an 8.6kW solar array. That's a big array!

That number assumes the panels track the Sun and capturing all available energy from dawn-to-dusk. But in most arrays the panels are mounted in a fixed position.  This reduces the daily energy capture by about 30%.  So we'd have to correspondingly increase the array size to compensate.

To get a better idea of the actual size and weight required we compared several off-the-shelf panels and put the data together in a spreadsheet.  [Panel Comparison Sheet](/MartianRoadtrip/_pages/01-research.md) is a link to the data if you want to look at it in detail.

From this we generated a scatter chart showing the weight and area covered by the various solar panels in both fixed and tracking layouts.

As expected the tracking arrays are smaller than the fixed arrays but also heavier.  Realistically the most we can carry is roughly 1000lbs. And we want to minimize the surface area to simplify setup.  So let's focus on the bottom left corner:

All of this assumes we're using off-the-shelf panels.  But what if we build our own panels? In theory that should allow us to better optimize the design and further reduce the area and weight.  We'll examine that in more detail next.

One important thing we haven't included is losses due to the electrical conversions feeding the power into the car.  This can be as much as 25%.  Obviously this would force everything to be even bigger and heavier. We'll also discuss ways to minimize this later.
